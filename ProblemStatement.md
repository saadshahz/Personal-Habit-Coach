# Problem Statement

## The Core Issue
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to align their daily time expenditure with their long-term goals. People "feel" busy but often lack objective data on where their time actually goes. This disconnect leads to:
- **Burnout**: Over-investing in low-impact areas.
- **Goal Neglect**: consistently missing time for health, learning, or family.
- **Lack of Awareness**: Inability to identify specific habits that need changing.

## The Solution
The **Personal Time & Habit Coach** is a digital tool designed to bridge this gap. It provides:
1.  **Objective Reflection**: A clear, data-driven mirror of daily habits.
2.  **Actionable Insight**: Not just charts, but specific "Micro-Change" suggestions.
3.  **Goal Alignment**: analyzing time spent specifically against stated personal goals.

## Target Audience
- Professionals seeking work-life balance.
- Students trying to optimize study schedules.
- Anyone looking to build better habits and break bad ones.
